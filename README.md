# 🦠🔨 Whack-a-Virus Game

**Whack-a-Virus** is a fun and fast-paced game developed using Python's **Turtle graphics** and **Pillow** libraries.  
Inspired by the classic **Whac-A-Mole**, this version replaces moles with sneaky **viruses** that randomly pop up on the screen.  
Your mission: **hammer the viruses** before they vanish — and rack up the highest score before time runs out!

## 🔧 Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Click on the viruses as they appear to smash them and earn points.  
- **Random Virus Spawning:** Viruses pop up at unpredictable positions to keep the game exciting and fast-paced.  
- **Countdown Timer:** A ticking timer adds urgency and tests your reaction speed.  
- **Score Tracking:** Displays your score in real time — how many viruses can you eliminate before time’s up?  
- **Sound Effects:** Satisfying audio feedback when scoring a hit or reaching game over, adding to the immersion.  
- **Themed Fun:** A creative and timely twist on Whac-a-Mole, themed around fighting off digital viruses.
